     <p>
       Trolls are human-like monsters, usually with large noses and fat yet muscular bodies. 
        Trolls may be ugly and slow-witted, or look and behave similarly like human beings,
         with no particularly grotesque characteristic about them. They are smart enough to use normal tools,
         such as clubs, knives and even bows and fire. They live in packs, and have a similar living structure 
         as early humans. They have been found killing or eating human being who walk into their caves.
