     <p>
       Yetis are large ape-like creatures, standing about 3.5 meters in height, and are covered in thick 
       white fur. They have jaws filled with teeth resembling human teeth, but with larger and more defined
       canines. They have immense strength, and are fast enough to catch up to bears and even wolfs. They live 
       high up on mountains where there is lots of snow to camouflage themselves in.

Meat description: Yeti meat is tough and has a rough texture. The closest comparison would be that of bear
meat. But anyone who eats the meat will increase their hair growth by a significant amount. It will even grow back
a full head of hair, permanently.
