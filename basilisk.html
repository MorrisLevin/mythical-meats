Meat description: The basilisks meat is very similar to the meat of a snake, and it is very sensitive and hard to prepare.
But the basilisks meat also has a very unusual effect on the human body. A very weird process happens 4-5
hours after consuming the meat of a basilisk. You start shedding your skin like a snake. This might seem scary
and unnerving, but it has its positive effects. After shedding your old skin, you will have a compleatly new
set of skin below. By going through this process, all negative effects such as sunburns, blackheads, and pimples
will be removed. Loose skin and burnt skin will also be shedded away, making this uncomfortable process totally 
worth it.
