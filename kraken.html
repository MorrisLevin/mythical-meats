        The kraken is a legendary cephalopod-like sea monster of gigantic size. It resembles a giant gray-blue 
        squid, with large suction cups and a circular mouth of sharp rotating teeth. It has long strong arms,
        powerful enough to break large ships, even when they are built out of strong metals. It has a diet that consists
        of sharks, smaller squids, dolphins and even whales.

Meat description: Kraken meat resembles octopus meat, and has a similar taste and texture. Surprisingly it is 
near impossible to tell them apart. But the kraken meat has an ability to make the person who has consumed it
to be able to breathe underwater and withstand high underwater pressure. This effect only lasts for roughly 3 hours,
so be careful if you go diving.
