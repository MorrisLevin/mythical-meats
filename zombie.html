     <p>
       Zombies are reincarnated humans, who have risen from their grave. Instead of dying they rise, with a 
       taste for human meat. They do not feel pain, and will not die until their brain is destroyed. It is 
       unknown why some humans become zombies, but what we do know is that they cannot be turned human nor alive again.
       They do not have a habitat, nor a certain place they like to stay. They can rise anytime, anywhere.

Meat description: Zombie meat is not very tasty, not does is have a nice texture. It is almost crumbly, and needs
to be cooked at high temparatures to remove all the bacteria. But it has the added bonus to shut down your nervus
system in such a way that u cannot feel pain for the next few hours. The duration depends on the amount
 of meat you eat. This can even work as a anesthetic.
