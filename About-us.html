             Mythical-Meats is a large corporation created for the purpose of hunting, trapping, containing and 
             slaying the mythical creatures around the world, and selling products from their bodies to humans
             for consumption. Another important priority of our is to inform you about these creatures,
              and what their meat will do to change your body.
              Most of these creatures are dangerous to humans and other animals alike. To reduce
             the human casualties from these creatures, we decided to reduce their numbers, though obviously
             avoiding the extinction of any of these species. Mythical-Meats are equipped with specially trained 
             hunters and butchers to ensure that the meat you consume is prepared safe and correct.
