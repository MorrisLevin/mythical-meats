     <p>
       Werewolfes are creatures that resemble a mix between a human and a wolf.
        There are characteristics that make werewolves special, and that allow a person
         to tell them apart from real wolves, such as the eyes, shape, and tail. When in
          human form, werewolves look and act like any normal human being, although they
           usually appear to be ill around nights when there is a full moon. And when they have 
           transformed from their human for into their wolf form, they become vicous creatures
           who will kill any creature on sight.

Meat description: Werewolf meat is tough, and tastes quite gaimy. But it is easily cooked
 and very forgiving. And with the right seasoning it can taste very delicous. It also has the added effect 
 of making the person who has eaten the meat to have an increased sense of smell and nocturnal eyesight.
