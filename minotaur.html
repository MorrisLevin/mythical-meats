     <p>
        The Minotaur is a monster with the body of a man and the head and tail of a bull. They have monstrous
        strength, even surpassing the Yeti. They are quite unintelligent, but intelligent enough to know
        how to use a club. A strike from a minotaurs club will kill nearly any creature, mythical or not. They
        live inside bushes they have reshaped as a maze. Anyone who enters the maze and gets lost, will most likely
        die.

Meat description: Minotaur meat is very similar to beef and pork. It is probably one of the more tasty and 
forgiving. It can be made into sausage or burgers, and is a great substitute for any sort of red meat.
It also has the added bonus of increasing your muscle growth for 10-12 days, and will of course increase your 
strength significantly.
