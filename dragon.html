        Dragons are huge, bat-winged reptiles or lizards with sharp scales running down their back,
         usually with long tails, sharp claws and teeth. They also posses the ability to breathe fire
          or other substances. Their scaly skin is hard to penetrate, and they are extreamly strong, fast,
           and dealy. Not to mention very smart. They are greedy creatures, stealing large amounts
            for treasure to bring to their lair. They live in large caves, high up in the mountains Europe.

Meat description: Dragons are large creatures, packed with muscle. A full-grown dragon can weigh up to 15 ton.
 This means a large amount of meat for every dragon captured. And the meat of a dragon is said to be the most
 flavorful and tender meat in the world. Though, since dragon live in extreamly high-temparature conditions, 
 their meat takes an unusually high amount of heat to actually cook. The meat of a dragon will also make a human 
 feel warm, making going outside in the cold feel like a summer day, even if barely clothed.
